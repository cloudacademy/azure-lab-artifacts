Then the iris data directory is passed into the preprocessing step as an input. This linking of inputs and outputs creates an implicit dependency and automatically tells Azure ML which order to run the steps. You could use the [run_after](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-pipeline-core/azureml.pipeline.core.builder.pipelinestep?view=azure-ml-py#run-after-step-) construct to declare the order of the steps, but since there is already a data dependency between the steps, this is not necessary:\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["import os\n","from azureml.pipeline.steps import PythonScriptStep\n","\n","# The URL for the Iris data that will be ingested in the first step of the pipeline\n","url =\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/azure-lab-artifacts/master/building-azure-ml-pipelines-using-the-azure-ml-sdk/iris.csv\"\n","        \n","\n","# Pipeline Steps\n","ingestion_step = PythonScriptStep(\n","    script_name='ingest.py',\n","    arguments=['--iris_data_dir', iris_data_dir, '--urls', url],\n","    inputs=[datastore_reference],\n","    outputs=[iris_data_dir],\n","    compute_target=cpu_cluster,\n","    source_directory=source_directory_ingest,\n","    runconfig=run_config,\n","    allow_reuse=True\n",")\n","\n","\n","preprocess_step = PythonScriptStep(\n","    script_name='preprocess.py',\n","    arguments=['--iris_data_dir', iris_data_dir, '--train_dir', train_dir,'--test_dir', test_dir],\n","    inputs=[iris_data_dir],\n","    outputs=[train_dir, test_dir],\n","    compute_target=cpu_cluster,\n","    source_directory=source_directory_preprocess,\n","    runconfig=run_config,\n","    allow_reuse=True\n",")\n","\n","print('The ingestion and preprocess pipelines have been created.')"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"source_hidden":false,"outputs_hidden":false},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"gather":{"logged":1598448938671}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Add another step for the training step of the pipeline:"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["\n","# Create training pipeline step\n","\n","train_step = PythonScriptStep(\n","    script_name='train.py',\n","    arguments=['--train_dir', train_dir, '--output_dir', model_dir],\n","    inputs=[train_dir],\n","    outputs=[model_dir],\n","    compute_target=cpu_cluster,\n","    source_directory=source_directory_train,\n","    runconfig=run_config,\n","    allow_reuse=False\n",")\n","print('The training pipeline has been created.')"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"source_hidden":false,"outputs_hidden":false},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"gather":{"logged":1598448947802}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Create the remaining pipeline steps for evaluating and deploying the model:"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Create the evaluate and deploy pipeline steps\n","\n","evaluate_step = PythonScriptStep(\n","    script_name='evaluate.py',\n","    arguments=['--model_dir', model_dir,'--test_dir', test_dir, '--accuracy_dir',  accuracy_dir],\n","    inputs=[test_dir,model_dir],\n","    outputs=[accuracy_dir],\n","    compute_target=cpu_cluster,\n","    source_directory=source_directory_evaluate,\n","    runconfig=run_config,\n","    allow_reuse=True\n",")\n","\n","deploy_step = PythonScriptStep(\n","    script_name='deploy.py',\n","    arguments=['--model_dir', model_dir, '--accuracy_dir',  accuracy_dir,'--test_dir', test_dir],\n","    inputs=[test_dir,accuracy_dir,model_dir],\n","    outputs=[output_dir],\n","    compute_target=cpu_cluster,\n","    source_directory=source_directory_deploy,\n","    runconfig=run_config,\n","    allow_reuse=True\n",")\n","\n","print('The evaluate and deploy pipelines have been created.')"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"source_hidden":false,"outputs_hidden":false},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"gather":{"logged":1598448950375}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Run Pipeline\n","\n","Submit the pipeline to initiate the run;
